## Background: 

As the target audience is the business market, I attempted to include subtle animations and interactions. The user is invited to unveil a better look of the car models through continuous colour overlays on the cars. A close button on the new display helps close the modal and return to home display.

CTA and the benefits of leasing remain visible to the user at all stages of banner interaction. 

All colours used have been taken from the provided asset files.

## Design and Layout
Banner and modals were designed from scratch on Figma using the fonts and assets provided. Sizing, spacing and layouts of the banner were developed based on the design.

Volkswagen website and general automotive ads were scanned for reference.


## Features

Designed for 970x250 billboard ad.
Page is responsive. Units like % and vw are predominantly used to achieve responsiveness.
CTA leads to Volkswagen website.

## Animations and interactions

Developed using GSAP.
